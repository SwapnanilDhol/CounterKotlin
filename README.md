# CounterKotlin
My First Kotlin Project

This app has a very basic layout:
A Slider that controls the values.
A Text Field that shows the values. 
A Reset button that resets the value of the textfield to 0 and also brings the slider back 
to its inital position. 

While learning how to make my first android app using Kotlin I was astonished to find the similarites between it and my 
go to language- Swift.
